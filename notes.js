// Random notes - probably don't run this.

// Variables:
// Variable names must start with _, $, or a letter - cannot be a number.
// Usually _variableName is for private variables, $ is for auto-generated usually (probably don't use).
// Use 'let' instead of 'var' - not as good for catching errors, e.g. if not initialised.
